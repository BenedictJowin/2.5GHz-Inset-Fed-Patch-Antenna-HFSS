# 2.5 GHz Inset-Fed Patch Antenna using Ansys HFSS

## Overview
This project involves the design and simulation of an inset-fed microstrip patch antenna operating at 2.5 GHz. The antenna performance is compared for two substrates: Rogers RT5880 and FR-4.

## Key Features
- Operating frequency: 2.5 GHz
- Feeding technique: Inset-fed (50 Ω)
- Substrates: Rogers RT5880 and FR-4
- Tool: Ansys HFSS

## Results
- RT5880: ~-29 dB return loss near 2.5 GHz  
- FR-4: ~-15 dB return loss with slight frequency shift
